<h2> Merge Sort </h2>
Merge sort is considered an efficient sort that on average takes O(n log n) time. For this task, you will implement merge sort to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

<h2> Input </h2>
The first line of the input contains T: the number of test cases

</br> Each test case consists of two lines: the first line is the size of the array, and the second line contains the elements of the array separated by spaces. As a tip, this will allow you to read in the size of the array and create a new array like so: int[] input = new int[size]. Next, use a loop and in.nextInt() to read in each array element - you already have the size, so you can determine when to stop iterating.

<h2> Output </h2>
For each test case, output output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the case number (starting at 1), and y is the sorted array. Use Arrays.toString() to print the array.
