<h2> Reverse Polish Notation (week 7, assignment 3) </h2>
Instructions:

Read lines from System.in until there are no more lines.

Each line consists of a mathematical expression in Reverse Polish Notation. Input consists of one or more lines of RPN.

"RPN", "Reverse Polish Notation" or "postfix" form, is a mathematical expression where operators ("+" addition, "-" subtraction, "" multiplication, "/" division) come after (postfix) the operands they work on.

Examples:

>2 3 +               add 2 and 3, yielding 5 <br>
>2 3 + 4 *           add 2 and 3, yielding 5, then multiply it by 4, yielding 20 <br>
>2 1 -               subtract 1 from 2 (2 - 1) yielding 1 <br>
>1 2 -               subtract 2 from 1, yielding -1 <br>

For each line read, evaluate the expression, and print out its numeric value as a Double.

Copy your Stack from assignment 1 or assignment 2. You may need to modify the Stack to contain Doubles.

You'll use the stack to evaluate the expression, with the following algorithm:

    Create an empty Stack of Doubles.

    When you read a number, push it onto the stack.

    When you read an operator, pop two values off the stack, and then push onto the stack one value, the result of
        applying that operator to the two popped values. In detail:
        When you read the operator "+", pop x and then y off the stack, and then push the value (x + y)
        When you read the operator "-", pop x and then y off the stack, and then push the value (x - y)
        When you read the operator "*", pop x and then y off the stack, and then push the value (x  y)
        When you read the operator "/", pop x and then y off the stack, and then push the value (x / y)

    When you've read the entire line, print out the value that's on the top of the Stack (or 0.0 if the Stack is empty).
A detailed example of evaluating the line "2 3 + 4 *":

    Start with the empty stack:               stack: []
    Read "2", and push it onto the stack:     stack: [2]
    Read "3", and push it onto the stack:     stack: [3, 2]
    Read "+", pop 3 into x,                   stack: [2], x = stack.pop() = 3
              pop 2 into y,                   stack: [], x = 3, y = stack.pop() = 2
              push 3 + 2 = 5 onto the stack   stack: [5]
    Read "4", and push it onto the stack:     stack: [4, 5]
    Read "*", pop 4 into x,                   stack: [5], x = stack.pop() = 4
              pop 5 into y,                   stack: [], x = 3, y = stack.pop() = 5
              push 4 * 5 = 20 onto the stack  stack: [20]
    Nothing more to read, so output the top of the stack, 20.0
It's helpful to be able to read one line at a time, and then to read each token in the line.

To do that, you can create one Scanner that reads System.in by line, and for each of those lines, create a second Scanner that reads just that line, by using the Scanner constructor that takes a String:

> public static double rpn(String line) { <br>
> // make a Stack here <br>
> try (Scanner lin = new Scanner(line)) { .... <br>
