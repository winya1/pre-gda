<h2> Lowest Common Ancestor </h2>
For this activity, you will work with a Binary Search Tree. Your task will be to populate the BST with the integers that are provided as input and then to output the value in the node that is the Lowest Common Ancestor of the first two nodes read in.

</br> In graph theory and computer science, the lowest common ancestor of two nodes v and w in a tree or directed acyclic graph is the lowest node that has both v and w as descendants, where we define each node to be a descendant of itself. Wikipedia By "lowest" we mean farthest from the root node.

<h2> Input </h2>
The first line of the input contains T: the number of integers to be inserted in the tree, followed by v and w, the target values. These should be used as targets, but not be inserted into the tree themselves. Actual values, to be inserted, follow. Output the value of the node that is the lowest common ancestor of v and w.

<h2> Output </h2>
Output one line containing the value of the node that is the lowest common ancestor of v and w.
