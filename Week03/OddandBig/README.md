<h2> Odd and Big </h2>
Write a function that takes three numbers and returns true if and only if all three numbers are odd and greater than 10. Do so by writing a helper function that determines whether a single number is odd and greater than 10. Call this function for every test case from the main function.

<h2> Input </h2>
The first line of the input contains T: the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

Each test case is a line containing three numbers: the numbers that should be checked.

<h2> Output </h2>
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1), and y is either Yes or No.
