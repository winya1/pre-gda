This week of GDA will be a little different from previous weeks of the program because it's our first project week.

### Videos
There are no videos to watch this week but this is a great time to catch up on videos that you might have missed in the first few weeks of the program or to rewatch videos that you didn't get a chance to fully absorb.

### Lab
Your work for this lab will be to extend the Falling Sands project that you completed for last week's lab.

WARNING: Unlike previous weeks, you are expected to complete this lab before our live session on Friday. The live session will be an opportunity for you to demo the work that you have done.

You should not have to change SandDisplay.java in order to complete this lab but you are welcome to if you feel up to the challenge.

Your project should implement at least three new features:

At least one additional material type. Use your imagination but examples might include:
<br> - Wood particles that float on water (but get buried in sand)
<br> - Ice that floats on water but turns into water over time
<br> - Helium balloons that float up
At least two advanced modeling features. Again, let your imagination guide you but you could imagine:
<br> - Multi-pixel objects that move as a unit (e.g. logs of wood, iceberg)
<br> - Unstable stacks: it doesn't look right for sand to form columns as it does in the basic project. Try forcing those columns to sag as real sand would.
<br> - Allow water to seep sideways through sand
<br> - Allow water to flow under metal objects to avoid this unrealistic situation
<br> - Make solid but moveable particles (like sand) slip if they're on an angled metal surface.
<br> - Implement color variations within a material: not all sand grains are the same tone of yellow. Add support for random color variation in the sand that you pour. Ensure that a grain's color stays the same once it is poured.
